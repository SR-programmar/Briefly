        <h2>What is Briefly?</h2>
        <p>
            Briefly is a Chrome extension built for visually impaired users that
            aims to make using the internet less time consuming. Briefly
            provides brief summaries of web pages through key commands and reads
            them aloud. It also includes an AI Agent named Rosie that helps with
            navigating websites and elements.
        </p>

        <h2>Briefly's basic features</h2>
        <p>
            Briefly is all about summarizing webpages. You can change the way
            your summary can be as well as pause, or cancel it if you want to
            stop hearing it.
        </p>

        <h2>Extension Activation</h2>
        <p>
            Briefly's key commands only work if the extension is active. For our
            key commands to work, you must interact with the webpage by clicking
            on the screen or pressing a key, like the space bar, on your
            keyboard. Web browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox implement this
            feature to avoid malicious script attacks and enhance user
            experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            After you've interacted with the webpage, press Ctrl + Shift on your
            keyboard to activate the extension. If you haven't interacted with
            the webpage yet, Briefly's screen reader will notify you that you
            need to interact with the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to deactivate the extension, press Ctrl + Shift on your
            keyboard again to deactivate it.
        </p>
        <h2>How to use Summarization feature</h2>
        <p>
            Once on a webpage, press Ctrl 3 times for Briefly to summarize the
            webpage. Once its finished, the screen reader will read aloud the
            summary. If you want to pause the summary, press CapsLock. If you
            want to cancel the summary, press Ctrl. You can change the length of
            the summary by pressing shift on your keyboard. You can change the
            type of summary by pressing caps lock, if the summary isn't playing.

        <p>
            The AI Agent's name is Rosie, she will help you navigate through the
            web. Hold down F2 until you hear a 'start' sound. Rosie will greet
            you the first time you speak to her. Once she's done, briefly will
            start listening to your microphone. You tell Rosie what to do and
            she will perform a certain function. At the moment, Rosie can
            perform the following actions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Answer questions</li>
            <li>Open a new URL in the current tab or a new tab</li>
            <li>List all tabs that are currently open</li>

            <li>Help with sending an email</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If you want to exit your conversation, press ESCAPE on your
            keyboard. If Rosie is presenting her response but you want to
            fast-forward it then press Ctrl. Doing so will make her stop but
            continue the conversation.
        </p>
